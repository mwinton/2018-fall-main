        "# Dynamic Programming\n",
        "\n",
        "We hope dynamic programming isn't a completely new idea to you.  If it is, not to worry, this part of the assignment is designed to make sure everyone has the base they need to do well in the rest of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Purpose\n",
        "\n",
        "The simplest way to think about dynamic programming, \"DP\", is nothing more than as an approach to optimize an algorithm:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Find an algorithm that \"brute forces\" a problem\n",
        "2.  Notice that it fits into the the class of algorithms DP can optimize\n",
        "3.  Implement algorithm using DP\n",
        "\n",
        "Dynamic programming does **not** have anything to do with on-the-fly code generation, online reinforcement learning, editing/optimizing compiled code while it's running... or anything else fancy.  So what does it do?  Read on!\n",
        "\n",
        "## Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "It boils down to a simple idea:  _don't let your code do the same work twice_.  In practice, this means that you should cache intermediate results (say, in a table).  Each time you need to evaluate a function with the same input after the first, you can look up the result in the cache rather than recomputing it.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will sometimes hear DP is used for problems whose solutions are combinations of the solutions to \"optimal subproblems\".  Unpacking this a little bit:  if each solution is just a combination of smaller versions of the same problem, and you cache the results of the smaller problems as you go, to the extent that you need those solutions in more than one place, you'll get a speed up.  For many problems, an exponential time naive implementation can be made to run in polynomial time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Don't let this sound complicated to you.**  All we're doing is adding a cache to avoid recomputing an \"expensive\" function.  Any time you see a problem that sounds like, \"Try every possible combination of X and pick the best\", you should think \"I wonder if there are any partial results here we can cache and reuse\".\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why is this important for natural language processing?\n",
        "\n",
        "In the second half of the course, we'll study tasks where the desired output is a sequence, a tree, or another type of rich structure. Unlike simple classification problems, we can't easily enumerate all the possible outputs - because there are exponentially many!\n",
        "\n",
        "In many such tasks, we can still decompose them into sub-problems, like predicting a single branch of a tree. Then by using dynamic programming, we can devise an efficient algorithm to find the highest-scoring solution. We'll make heavy use of this approach when we study parsing and sequence labeling tasks like part-of-speech tagging.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dynamic programming is also useful as a conceptual tool. Decomposing a large problem into subproblems can be as useful for us as for computers, since it lets us reason about small, controlled cases and extend them into a more complex solution. Dynamic programming is also closely related to recursion - a concept underlying many fundamental ideas in both computer science and linguistics."

How many ways to the top?  8 + 13 = 21.  (Note that you don't have to count \"get to second-to-the-top and take two regular steps\" separately because the \"13\" already includes them.)\n",

Similarly, if you have $ways(n - 2)$ to get to the $n - 2$ step and then take a big step to stair $n$.  There is no other way to get to stair $n$ except by one of those two sets of options.  There is no overlap between those sets of sequences as sequences in the first set always end in a \"regular\" step and those sequences in the second set always end in a \"big\" step.\n",
