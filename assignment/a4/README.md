# Assignment 4: Part of Speech

This assignment consists of one notebook:

* [Part of Speech](Part-of-Speech.ipynb)

### Visualizations (optional)

We've built an [interactive visualization](https://hmm-dot-nlp-visualizations.appspot.com/hmm?sentence=James+ate+the+food&vizMode=viterbi&numFormat=log) for this assignment, which we hope you'll find useful as you work through your implementations of Viterbi, and Forward-Backward. In particular, you can inspect partial hypotheses (tag sequences), and see how the backpointers trace through the Viterbi table (i.e. Î´ or the chart).

_Note: the tag set and grammar in these demos is simplified to reduce visual clutter, so don't be surprised if numbers don't match with your implementation!_


## Submission instructions

As always, you should commit your changes often with `git add` and `git commit`. As this is a new assignment, there may be bugfixes and corrections - so keep your eye on Piazza and GitHub for any updates.

Please submit by running the submit script:
```
./assignment/submit.sh -u your-github-username -a 4
```
You can view your work in your usual submission repo on the `a4-submit` branch.
