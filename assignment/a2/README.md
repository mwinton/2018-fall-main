# Assignment 2: Text Classification & Deep Learning

This assignment consists of three notebooks:
* [Prelude](Prelude.ipynb), introducing basic text processing for ML. No work,
  but you'll need this information for the rest of the assignment so read it carefully!
* [Exploration](Exploration.ipynb), in which we'll introduce the Stanford 
  Sentiment Treebank (SST) and train a baseline Naive Bayes model.
* [Neural Bag of Words Model](NeuralBOW.ipynb), in which you'll implement and train a Neural 
  Bag-of-Words model on the SST.
* [Convolutional Neural Networks](CNN.ipynb), in which you'll explore a convolutional neural network
* [ML Fairness](MLFairness.ipynb), in which you'll explore the ways things can go horribly (and subtly!) wrong

This assignment builds directly on the [TensorFlow Introduction](../a1/tensorflow/tensorflow.ipynb) from Assignment 1, so be sure you're comfortable with that material before you start on the Neural BOW notebook. You may also want to review [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html), which we'll be using to manage the datasets.

Also note that part (e) is likely the most time-consuming and difficult part of this assignment, so don't put it off until the last minute!

## Submission Instructions

As with Assignment 1, please submit by running the submit script, only with `-a 2` (since this is assignment 2).
```
./assignment/submit.sh -u your-github-username -a 2
```

It is your responsibility to check that your work has made it to your GitHub repository in the `a2-submit` branch.  As always, a small number of points will be given in each assignment for submitting in the right place.
