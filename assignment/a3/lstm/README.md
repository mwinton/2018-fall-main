# Recurrent Neural Network Language Model

This assignment consists of two notebooks and a number of py files.  Files you should pay special attention to:

* **Start here:** [rnnlm-instructions.ipynb](rnnlm-instructions.ipynb) (Instructions: do not edit.)
* [rnnlm-workbook.ipynb](rnnlm-workbook.ipynb) (Answer notebook: your work goes here.)
* [rnnlm.py](rnnlm.py) (LM implementation, and most of your code.)

__Hint:__ Read the instructions!

## Other resources

This assignment builds on the nplm notebook, so you may want to review that before you start. (**Hint:** borrow ideas and code!)

* [nplm.ipynb](../../materials/nplm/nplm.ipynb)

As always, you should commit your changes often with `git add` and `git commit`.
