        "<p>\n",

Passing this through the embedding layer, we retrieve the word embedding for each, resulting in $x$ having shape batch_size x max_time x embedding_dim.  I find it useful to draw this out on a piece of paper.  When you do, you should end up with a rectangular prism with batch_size height, max_time width and embedding_dim depth.  Many tensors in this assignment share this shape (e.g. $o$, the output from the LSTM, which represents the hidden layer going into the softmax to make a prediction at every time step in every batch).\n",
