# Assignment 3: Language Models

This assignment consists of two parts:

* **Part 1:** [Smoothed n-gram Language Models](ngram/ngram.ipynb)
* **Part 2:** [Neural Language Model](lstm/README.md)

Part 1 is somewhat shorter than Part 2.

Please read the instructions carefully in the notebook and, especially, in the code documentation for the functions you'll need to implement. As always, come to OH or post on Piazza if you have any questions!

This assignment builds on the demo notebooks language models.
* n-gram: [lm1.ipynb](../../materials/simple_lm/lm1.ipynb)
* Neural: [nplm.ipynb](../../materials/nplm/nplm.ipynb)

You might also want to look over the notes on Python dictionaries if you're not familiar with `enumerate`, `dict.items`, `defaultdict`, or `dict.get`: [ngram/dict\_notes.md](ngram/dict_notes.md)

As always, you should commit your changes often with `git add` and `git commit`.

## Submission instructions

As with previous assignments, please submit by running the submit script:
