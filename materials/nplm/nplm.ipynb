    "# Neural Probabilistic Language Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll implement the [Neural Probabilistic Language Model (Bengio et al. 2003)](http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/mlpapers/paper_files/BengioDVJ03.pdf). This model was one of the first applications of deep learning to NLP, predating `word2vec` by a whole decade! Many of the ideas in this model, however, are remarkably current - such as the skip-layer connection now popular in the form of \"residual networks.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is a straightforward extension of n-gram language modeling: it uses a fixed context window, but instead of a table it uses a neural network to predict the next word. It'll also serve as a segue to Assignment 4, in which you'll implement a recurrent neural network language model (RNNLM).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note on training time\n",
    "The NPLM can take a while to train on a slower machine - we clocked it at 10-20 min on a 2-core Cloud Compute instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using a cloud compute instance, you can add more CPUs without having to re-do setup. With your instance turned off, go to https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances, click your instance, and go to \"Edit\". Under machine type, select \"Custom\" and pick 4-8 CPUs and 2 GB of RAM. Make sure you shut down when you're done, and use the Edit menu again to scale back the size to something less expensive."

    "$$ P(w_i | w_{i-1}, w_{i-2}, ..., w_0) \\approx P(w_i | w_{i-1}, ..., w_{i-k}) $$\n",

    "$$ P(w_i | w_{i-1}, ..., w_{i-k}) = f(w_i, (w_{i-1}, ..., w_{i-k})) $$\n",

    "![NPLM architecture](nplm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly, there are three parts:\n",
    "1. **Embedding layer**: map words into vector space\n",
    "2. **Hidden layer**: compress and apply nonlinearity\n",
    "3. **Output layer**: predict next word using softmax\n",
    "\n",
    "The model also has *skip connections* between the embedding layer and the output layer. This just means that the output layer takes as input the concatenated embeddings in addition to the hidden layer output. This was considered an unusual pattern, but has recently become popular again in the form of [Residual Networks](http://www.kaiminghe.com/icml16tutorial/icml2016_tutorial_deep_residual_networks_kaiminghe.pdf) and [Highway Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00387).\n",

    "With modern computers and a couple tricks, we should be able to get a decent model to run in just a few minutes - a far cry from the three weeks it took in 2003!"
